# Timesheet Management Module - EMS Application

This document outlines the implementation of the timesheet management module, a core feature within the Employee Management System (EMS) for Wouessi Digital. This module allows employees to log their working hours and associated tasks, and provides managers with approval workflows.

## Project Context

This module is part of a larger EMS application developed by Quantum Coders, aimed at streamlining HR processes. The EMS application is designed to enhance operational efficiency for Wouessi Digital, covering employee management, onboarding, payroll, performance, promotions, benefits, timesheets, and leave management.

**Project Aim:** Deliver a robust and user-friendly system for Wouessi Digital that streamlines the management of employee data and HR processes, enhancing operational efficiency and supporting effective decision-making.

**Project Overview:** A comprehensive web application designed to optimize HR processes, from employee tracking to advanced performance management and payroll.

**Tech Stack:** React (Frontend), Node.js (Backend), MongoDB (Database).

**Tools:** VS Code, Figma, Git & GitHub, AWS.

## Timesheet Management Module Details

This module specifically addresses the "Employee Timesheets" feature, enabling employees to log their working hours and associated tasks. It also provides managers with the ability to approve or reject these timesheets, with comments for rejections, and includes total hour calculations.

**Key Features:**

* **Employee Time Logging:** Allows employees to record daily work hours and task descriptions.
* **Manager Approval Workflow:** Enables managers to approve or reject submitted timesheets.
* **Rejection Comments:** Provides a text area for managers to add comments when rejecting a timesheet.
* **Total Hour Calculation:** Automatically calculates and displays the total hours worked.
* **Responsive Design:** Ensures usability across various devices.
* **Form Validation:** Validates user input to ensure data integrity.

**Implementation Details:**

The provided HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code implement a foundational timesheet management interface, comprised of a form for employees to enter timesheet data, and a separate table for managers to review.

**Timesheet Form and Timesheet Table (HTML, CSS, JavaScript):**

* **HTML Structure:**
    * Defines a form (`timesheet-form`) with input fields for date, project, hours, and description.
    * Uses semantic HTML5 elements and `aria-label` attributes for accessibility.
    * Organizes form elements into `form-group` divs.
* **CSS Styling:**
    * Styles the form elements for a clean and user-friendly interface.
    * Uses a light purple color scheme with darker accents for headings and labels.
    * Implements responsive design using media queries to adapt to different screen sizes.
* **JavaScript Functionality (`TimeSheet.js`):**
    * Includes validation functions (`validateHours`, `validateDate`, `validateProject`) to ensure data integrity.
    * Adds an event listener to the form's submit event to perform client-side validation.
    * Displays alert messages for invalid input.
    * Ensures hours are between 0 and 24, dates are entered, and project names are at least 3 characters.
* **Table View (HTML, CSS, JavaScript):**
    * Defines a table layout for timesheet entries, including date, project/task, hours, status, and actions.
    * Includes a `div` for displaying total hours and `textarea` for rejection comments.
    * Styles the timesheet table, buttons, and other elements for a user-friendly interface. It uses media queries for responsive design, ensuring the timesheet is viewable on various screen sizes.
    * **JavaScript Functionality:**
        * **`calculateTotalHours()`:** Iterates through the table rows, extracts the hours from each entry, and calculates the total hours.
        * **`approveTimesheet(button)`:** Changes the status of a timesheet entry to "Approved" when the "Approve" button is clicked.
        * **`rejectTimesheet(button)`:** Displays a text area for entering a rejection comment. When the "Reject" button is clicked again, it changes the status to "Rejected," displays the comment in an alert, and hides the comment area.
    * **Data Representation:** Timesheet data is represented as rows in an HTML table, with status and hours stored in corresponding table cells.

This initial implementation provides a proof-of-concept for the timesheet management functionality. It will be further developed and integrated with React, Node.js, and MongoDB in subsequent phases.

**Future Enhancements:**

* Backend integration for data persistence.
* User authentication and authorization.
* Integration with the payroll system for accurate salary calculations.
* Dynamic data input and date selection.
* More comprehensive status options.

## Development Workflow

1.  **Ticket Creation:** Create detailed ClickUp tickets for each task, including secondary or allied work, to meet sprint goals.
2.  **Branching:** Create feature branches (e.g., `feat_tdp_XXX`) for each task.
3.  **Development:** Implement the feature, ensuring clean and well-documented code.
4.  **Pull Request (PR):**
    * Create a concise PR description (max 100 words), summarizing the implementation.
    * Include the ClickUp Task ID in the PR title (following Gitworkflow instructions).
    * Target the feature branch (e.g., `feat_tdp_XXX`) as the base branch.
5.  **Code Review:** Request a code review from team members.
6.  **Testing:** Perform thorough testing to ensure quality.
7.  **Merge:** Merge the feature branch into the target branch after approval.
8.  **Documentation:** Update relevant documentation.

## Project Roadmap Highlights

* **Initial Setup and Access Configuration:** Secure access and set up the development environment.
* **Knowledge Transfer (KT) Sessions and Code Analysis:** Understand the application's functionality.
* **Documentation & Application Designs:** Create UML diagrams and architectural schemas.
* **Development:** Implement features, integrating frontend and backend.
* **Deployment and Testing:** Deploy to development environments and conduct testing.
* **Final Delivery:** Deliver the MVP or targeted features with complete documentation.
